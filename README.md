# OBSERVATIONS
 During the analysis processes, I discovered the following:
1. The restaurant received more customers on the two major weekends (Saturday and Sundays) than any other days.
2. There are more orders from males compare to females.
3. The orders on the major weekends are in the night and and afternoon majorly for Thursdays and somehow varies on Fridays but dinner should still be more than the lunch that will be prepare.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
These recommendations are given based on what was seen in this dataset.
1. The company can avoid waste of resources by cooking less food on Thursdays and Fridays, compare to the amount of food that will be prepare on Saturdays and Sundays
2. The restaurant should make sure there is enough food ready in the afternoon on Thursdays and Fridays, and dinner should be much  in the night on Saturdays and Sundays, to avoid disappointing the customers.
3. The company should be mindful of how they cook on Fridays, has the restauran receive less order on Fridays.
